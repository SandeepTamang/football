 <h1> Indian Football Team</h1>
 
  <p>
    The Indian national football team, known as the "Blue Tigers," represents India in international football competitions. Founded in 1937, the team is governed by the All India Football Federation (AIFF). India's home ground is the Salt Lake Stadium in Kolkata, one of the largest football stadiums in the world.
  </p>
  <p>
    Over the years, the team has seen both successes and challenges. India won the Asian Games football gold in 1951 and 1962. The team's most notable achievement in recent times was breaking into the top 100 of the FIFA World Rankings in 2017 after a long hiatus.
  </p>
  <p>
    Football in India has been growing in popularity, with initiatives to promote the sport at grassroots levels and the formation of professional leagues like the Indian Super League (ISL) and I-League, contributing to its development.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Indian football team continues to strive for success on the international stage, aiming to qualify for major tournaments and make a mark in the global football community.
